<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Redraw graphic</strong></p>

<P>Click here to redraw the graphic with student's answers. When redrawing, graphics to show (current student, course media, category media and/or site media) are considered. It's considered too if you want to zoom and if media scores (course, category, site) must be written. When the option "Write medias" is unmarked, current student's scores are written in black colour. But when marked all scores are written in the same colour as corresponding graphic.</p>
